</P><H1> Image processing</H1><P>When creating your own image filter, you should begin by creating a reference implementation.
This allow experimenting with different math formulas and effects without having to worry about optimization and crashes.

Then create a pixel loop where you have more control and can start to apply SIMD.

</P><P>
If the filters take a long time to execute, multi-threading might be useful depending on how it is implemented.
With lower resolutions or trivial operations, SIMD is so fast that a single thread is complete before a second thread had the time to start.

Both basic pixel loops and lambdas may find this way of reading pixel data useful for prototyping.

</P><P>
Useful for prototyping something that later will become an optimized in-place image filter.
The map functions simply call your lambda function for each pixel in the image and gives the x, y coordinate as arguments.
If you enter startX and startY offsets, these will be uniformly added to the x, y coordinates entering your function, which is useful for panorating a view or partial updates of blocks.
Input images and other resources can be captured by the lambda.
The returned result is automatically saturated to the resulting color type and written without any need for bound checks.

Allocates a new image of the specified dimensions before evaluating the lambda function on each pixel.
Same performance as allocating an image yourself and then calling the map function.

When taking inputs, try to allow unaligned images if you don't plan to use it for SIMD later.
When returning a result that was just created and not a sub-image let it be aligned or even ordered to describe it as closely as possible.

</P><H2> Loops with image_writePixel (slow but safe)</H2><P>When beginning to optimize, make your own pixel loop using x and y integers.

</P><P>
Because pixels on the same row are packed together in memory, you should try to read the pixels of different x coordinates before moving to the next row along y.
Otherwise the memory will be read in an order that is hard to predict when reading memory into data cache.

</P><P>
Storing the dimensions before the loop prevents calling non-inlined functions inside the loop.
Calling functions that can not be inlined inside of a loop would be very bad for performance by clearing the CPU's execution window with each call.

Writing the result using image_writePixel will automatically saturate to fit into 8 bits.

</P><P>
Use safe pointers instead of raw pointers when you need better error messages with tighter memory bounds in debug mode, but can not afford any performance penalty in release mode.

</P><P>
Safe pointers may only be used within the lifetime of the resource, because the safe pointer does not affect any reference counting for the allocation.

</P><P>
Saturation of the result can be done using an atomic if statement containing a basic assignment, which will be optimized into a conditional move instruction taking a single cycle on most CPU architectures.
Because we are adding two unsigned images, we do not have to clamp any negative values to zero and only need to clamp values larger than the largest unsigned 8-bit integer (255).

SIMD vectorization requires that the images are aligned.
Ordered images such as OrderedImageRgbaU8 are also aligned.
Sub-images from image_getSubImage are not aligned, because otherwise their construction would require runtime checks that might randomly fail and requesting an aligned image for SIMD will often also assume ownership of any padding bytes for writing over with garbage data.

</P><P>
When using readAligned or writeAligned in debug mode, you get both bound checks and alignment checks at runtime.
So make sure that you enable debug mode when developing with the SIMD vectors.

</P><P>
You might want to check which SIMD functions are available before writing your algorithm, because some are only available for certain datatypes.

</P><P>
Iterate in multiples of 16 bytes over the pixel rows to stay aligned with the memory.
When adding an integer to a pointer, the address offset is multiplied by the pointer's element size.
This means that a pointers of uint32_t for a color pixel only needs to add 4 elements to the pointer to move 16 bytes, while pointers of uint16_t moves 8 elements and pointers of uint8_t moves 16 elements.

Then you might want to take advantage of 256-bit SIMD vectors, but don't want to copy and paste code to use both U8x16 and U8x32.
For functions working directly on values without reading nor writing, you can use templates to have multiple vector lengths supported at the same time.
For a filter however, you only need to generate the code for the biggest available vector size, so we use U8xX and laneCountX_8Bit for processing 8-bit monochrome images using type aliases.
When building with AVX2 (-mavx2 for g++), the X vector types (F32xX, I32xX, U32xX, U16xX, U8xX) change size from 128 bits to 256 bits and their lane counts (laneCountX_32Bit, laneCountX_16Bit, laneCountX_8Bit) also double.
If you do not have AVX2 on your computer for testing this, you can force the X vector to be at least 256 bits by defining the macro EMULATE_256BIT_X_SIMD globally or in settings.h.
The aligned image types and buffers allocated by the library are always aligned with DSR_MAXIMUM_ALIGNMENT from settings.h, so you can safely use the X and F vectors on any buffer or aligned image.
