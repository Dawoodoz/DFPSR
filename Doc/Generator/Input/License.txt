Title: License terms for David Forsgren Piuva's Software Renderer

The software renderer is using a combination of the ZLIB open source license (for David Piuva's code) and public domain (for other people's code).

The ZLIB license essentially requires the copyright notice to remain in source code redistributions and that the origin is not missrepresented. This is just common sense made explicit for the sake of consumer protection, because lying about having written the library would be a scam against the buyers.

Public domain essentially means owned by the people, to prevent code from being withdrawn. When a project has many contributors, the risk of having one of them withdrawing copy rights increases significantly. Public domain code don't have any copyright holder, so pulling back contributions is only possible if the code turns out to be illegal.

Title2: Public domain (other people's code)

The renderer has embedded the stb_image library using public domain terms (unlicense.org). While you could use stb_image under the more restrictive MIT license terms out of respect for its creators, it's essentially nullified by the more permissive public domain option.

You may use the media files in SDK examples for your own project. Just don't falsely claim to have made it, because that would be fraud.

Title2: License summary (for those who worry about getting sued)

The stb_image library lets you choose between MIT and public domain, so the least restrictive option becomes public domain. When combined with the non-optional ZLIB license from the majority of the DFPSR library, the ZLIB terms are more restrictive than public domain. In conclusion, all you need to follow is the ZLIB terms for the library as a whole because public domain is compatible with all open source license terms.

For releasing source code, you can only violate the terms as a whole if you alter a copyright notice or lie about who made what.

For releasing binaries, you can only violate the terms as a whole if you lie about who made what. There are no requirements to credit anyone in released binaries, because stb_image lets you choose the public domain license.

You are not forced to share modifications, because the library does not contain any GPL license. It is however in a company's best interest to share bug-fixes so that they don't have to be re-applied when pulling a new version.
