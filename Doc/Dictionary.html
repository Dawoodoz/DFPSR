</P><H1> Dictionary</H1><P>
</P><P>
To avoid confusion when reading the code comments and documentation, some contemporary programming words will have to be explained in this dictionary.

</P><H2> Acronyms</H2><P>
</P><P>
While one should mostly avoid using abbreviations in source code, writing davidForsgrenPiuvasSoftwareRenderer:: instead of dsr:: in headers would take too much space and not help to explain the purpose of the code.

</P><P>
ABI | Application Binary Interface.
How a library is linked and called after the source code has been compiled, which is a binary representation.

</P><P>
API | Application Programming Interface.
How a library is called in the source code, which can be checked by the programming language's type system.
A wrapper to call code written in a different language is an API, because the ABI has been wrapped in pre-declarations explaining the meaning of the bits in the calling language's type system.

</P><P>
AD | Anno Domini (In the lord's years), used for years after the birth of prophet Jesus Christ in the Gregorian calendar, which is the calendar used to name versions of the C++ programming language.

</P><P>
C | A programming language created by Dennis Ritche in the 1970s AD.
Not to be confused with the C# language.

</P><P>
C++ | A programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the 1980s AD. Inherited most of the core design from C for easy porting while adding new features.

</P><P>
DSR | David's (Forsgren Piuva's) software renderer, the shorter acronym for this library and the surrounding framework.

</P><P>
DFPSR | David Forsgren Piuva's software renderer, the longer acronym for this library and the surrounding framework.

</P><P>
HTML | Hyper Text Markup Language. A text format adapted for reading on computers instead of printing, by containing links and not dictating any page layout. Most known as the default format for websites.

</P><P>
LOD | Level Of Detail. Often referring to a 3D model's polygon count, but can also apply to other types of assets.

</P><P>
MIP | Multum in parvo. A term used for texture pyramids because there are multiple image resolutions stored in the same texture. Used to avoid noisy undersampling of textures that are seen from far away.

</P><P>
RAII | Resource Allocation Is Initialization, an important design principle in C++ that prevents memory leaks by letting types handle heap memory allocation automatically in constructors and destructors.

</P><P>
SIMD | Single Instruction Multiple Data.
A power efficient hardware design for packing arrays of elements into the same register and processing them at the same time using multiple lanes.
Makes the machine instructions faster, by both increasing the number of elements processed per instruction, and reducing the pipeline latency needed to run a single instruction by using smaller types.

</P><H2> Expressions</H2><P>
</P><P>
Array | A coherent and indexed block of memory with alignment for each element to allow random access.
dsr::Array creates a heap allocation based on a size given at runtime during construction.
dsr::FixedArray does not make any heap allocation, but can not change its size at runtime.

</P><P>
Et cetera | Latin expression that is often used to indicate that a list of examples is not exhaustive, roughly meaning "and all the rest".

</P><P>
List | A collection that can be populated with elements at runtime, where indices to the elements are treated as something temporary.
dsr::List is an array based list, and simply called List to save some typing when there is no linked list among the framework's generic collections.

</P><P>
Vector | An array of numbers, used for multi-dimensional math or SIMD vectorization.

</P><P>
Vectorize | To use vectors in order to solve a math problem.
Instead of treating one million pixels as independent objects with a heap allocation for each pixel, we vectorize images into memory aligned arrays and loop over them using chunks of shorter SIMD vectors. 

</P><P>
Scalar | A single number, as opposed to a collection of multiple numbers.
