RASPICAM EXAMPLE FOR RASPBERRY PI
Tested on Ubuntu Mate using a Raspberry Pi 3B.

INSTALLING THE RASBICAM LIBRARY
* Update your system if you haven't for a while:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
* Install cmake:
	sudo apt-get install cmake
* Download and extract the latest version of Raspicam:
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/raspicam/files/latest/download
* Enter the raspicam-x.x.x folder and create a build folder:
	mkdir build
* Enter the build folder:
	cd build
* Generate a Makefile from the parent directory's CMakeLists.txt:
	cmake ..
* Compile using the Makefile:
	make
* Install the compiled result:
	sudo make install

CAMERA INSTALLATION
Mount the camera onto the camera connector.
* Connect the cable to your Raspberry Pi camera if it's not already connected.
* Remove the tape from the camera port.
* Pull up the plastic edges holding the back against the connectors.
* Put in the cable all the way.
* Hold the cable in place by pressing down the plastic edges. This is important!
* Open the Raspberry configuration from a terminal using:
	sudo raspi-config
* Activate the camera interface.
	This will be located in the top menu or the interface sub-menu.
* Reboot after enabling the camera interface.
* Remove any lens protection to avoid getting a black or foggy image.

CAMERA TESTING WITH RASPISTILL
* Open a terminal anywhere and try the camera.
	raspistill -t 1000000

CAMERA TESTING WITH SDK EXAMPLE 
* Open SDK/Raspicam in a terminal and run the build script.
	chmod +x build.sh
	./build.sh
* You should see a grayscale camera feed in a window.
